   1.function Initialization is to get the 6x1 start_joints and target_joints matrixs for calculating
 4x4 g_start and g_target matrixs.

   2.function ComputePoints is to find the other critical points for define the two parallel lines
Inputs: 4x4 homogeneous matrixs
Outputs: point1 is on the first line including point_start, 
         point2 is on the second line including point_target.
         k1,b1 the slope & intercept between point_start and point1
         k2,b2 the slope & intercept between point_target and point2

   3.RobotControl is to control the manipulator to do the 'place and draw' task.
